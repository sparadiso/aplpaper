abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to review the development of NuvaRing over the past decade to illustrate its use-effectiveness and acceptance as an alternative contraceptive option for women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The data were extracted from the literature using computerised MEDLINE system. NuvaRing is a new combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring made of ethylene-vinyl-acetate copolymer, releasing 120 microg etonorgestrel and 15 microg ethinyloestradiol per day. This ring is inserted on any day from day 1 to day 5 of a menstrual cycle for 21 days, thereafter removed for 7 days ring-free period and discarded.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Complete inhibition of ovulation is observed during treatment with this device. Clinical exposure to NuvaRing for 1786 women-years has resulted in 21 pregnancies, giving a Pearl Index of 1.18. Withdrawal bleeding (4.7-5.3 days) is regular (97-99{\%} of cycles) with rare incidence of irregular bleeding (2.6-6.4{\%}). The cycle control is good with the use of this combined contraceptive vaginal ring. NuvaRing is well tolerated and accepted by women as compared to oral pill.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: NuvaRing is an effective vaginal contraceptive option for women. However, further study is needed for monitoring its long-term effectiveness and impact on patient's quality of life since the NuvaRing is marketed in many countries.},

@article{Ganapathysubramanian2009,
abstract = {A review. Many material systems of fundamental as well as industrial importance are significantly affected by underlying fluctuations and variations in boundary conditions, initial conditions, material property, as well as variabilities in operating and surrounding conditions. There has been increasing interest in analyzing, quantifying, and controlling the effects of such uncertain inputs on complex systems. This has resulted in the development of techniques in stochastic anal. and predictive modeling. A general application of stochastic techniques to many significant problems in engineering has been limited due to the lack of realistic, viable models of the input variability. Ideas of material informatics can be used to utilize available data about the input to construct a data-driven, computationally viable model of the input variability. This promising coupling of material informatics and stochastic anal. is investigated and some results are showcased using a simple example of analyzing diffusion in heterogeneous random media. Limited microstructural data is utilized to construct a realistic model of the thermal cond. variability in a system. This reduced-order model then serves as the input to the stochastic partial differential equation describing thermal diffusion through random heterogeneous media. [on SciFinder(R)]},

@article{Cecen2014,
abstract = {The diffusion media (DM) has been shown to be a vital component for performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The DM has a dual-layer structure composed of a macro-substrate referred to as the gas diffusion layer (GDL) coated with a micro-porous layer (MPL). Efficient prediction of the effective transport properties of the DM from its internal structure is essential to optimizing the multifunctional characteristics of this critical component. In this work, a unique data-driven approach to establishing structure–property correlations is introduced and applied to the case of gas diffusion in the GDL and MPL. This new approach provides an automated process to produce unbiased estimators to microstructural variance, in contrast to many process-related (hence biased) parameters employed by prominent correlations in the field. The present approach starts with a rigorous quantification of microstructure in the form of n-point statistics. It is followed by the identification of the key aspects of the internal structure through the use of principle component analysis. A data-driven correlation is established when the principal components are related to effective diffusivity by multivariate linear regression. This data-driven approach is compared to the conventional correlations and shown to achieve a very high accuracy for capturing the diffusive transport in the tested PEFC components.},

The foundation of such an infrastructure is the explicitly and formally modeled information. This foundation enables knowledge in different forms, and best manufacturing practices, to be modeled and captured into tools to support the product lifecycle management. This paper discusses the development of ontologies, Semantic Web infrastructure and Web related technologies that make such an infrastructure development possible. While many of the issues addressed in this paper are applicable to a wide spectrum of molecular-based products, we focus our work on the development of pharmaceutical informatics to support Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) as well as drug product development as case studies to illustrate the various aspects of this infrastructure.},

This paper investigates the interests of the stakeholders of the materials industry in the effort of setting the basis for standard-compliant formats for engineering materials test data used in materials test certificates (TCs). Test certificates provide a guarantee of origin, characteristics and materials specifications. A transition to standardised electronic-test certificates (E-TCs) is thought to offer advantages over the static alternatives currently in use. This work highlights that the stakeholders involved in the process have a general need for a standard compliant data model yet their particular interests might not be completely aligned. The choice of an open, non-proprietary, data format and compatibility of the standard with legacy technological solutions prove to be critical for the implementation of standardised E-TCs. },

It transforms essentially design files to fully functional products. However, it is still hampered by low productivity, poor quality and uncertainty of final part mechanical properties. The root cause of undesired effects lies in the control aspects of the process. Optimization is difficult due to limited modelling approaches. Physical phenomena associated with additive manufacturing processes are complex, including melting/solidification and vaporization, heat and mass transfer etc. The goal of the current study is to map available additive manufacturing methods based on their process mechanisms, review modelling approaches based on modelling methods and identify research gaps.

abstract = {New materials are traditionally developed using costly and time-consuming trial and error experimental efforts. This is followed by an even lengthier material-certification process. Consequently, it takes 10-20 years before a newly discovered material is commercially employed. An alternative approach to the development of new materials is the so-called materials-by-design approach within which a material is treated as a complex system and its design and optimization is carried out by employing computer-aided engineering analyses, predictive tools and available material databases. In the present work, the materials-by-design approach is utilized to redesign a grade of high-strength low-alloy steels with improved mechanical properties (primarily strength and fracture toughness), processability (e.g. castability, hot formability and weldability) and corrosion resistance. Toward that end, a number of material thermodynamics, kinetics of phase transformations, and physics of deformation and fracture computational models and databases have been developed/assembled and utilized within a multidisciplinary, two-level material-by-design optimization scheme. To validate the models, their prediction is compared against the experimental results for the related steel high-strength low-alloy 100. Then the optimization procedure is employed to determine the optimal chemical composition and the tempering schedule for a newly designed high-strength low-alloy steel grade with enhanced mechanical properties, processability and corrosion resistance.},

abstract = {Abstract Product development (PD) is a broad field of endeavor dealing with the planning, design, creation, and marketing of a new product. This revolutionary research domain has become of paramount importance to beat the competition for multidisciplinary products which are larger in size and have a longer development time. The main focus of this article is to exploit lean thinking concepts in order to manage, improve and develop the product faster while improving or at least maintaining the level of performance and quality. Lean thinking concepts encompass a board range of tools and methods intended to produce bottom line results however, value stream mapping (VSM) method is used to explore the wastes, inefficiencies, non-valued added steps in a single, definable process out of complete product development process (PDP). This single step is highly complex and occurs once while the {\{}PDP{\}} lasts for 3–5 years. A case study of gas turbine product has been discussed to illustrate and justify the use of proposed framework. In order to achieve this, the following have been performed: First of all a current state map is developed using the Gemba walk. Furthermore, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) brainstormed to explore the wastes and their root causes found during the Gemba walk and current state mapping. A future state map is also developed with removing all the wastes/inefficiencies. Besides numerous intangible benefits, it is expected that the {\{}VSM{\}} framework will help the development teams to reduce the {\{}PD{\}} lead-time by 50{\%}. },

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of different normalization norms within multiple attribute decision making (MADM) models. The application of the work is dedicated to gear material selection for power transmission. To this end, the general scheme of the decision model is first presented, with close attention to the context of material selection. Subsequently, the entropy method and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) are employed to weigh the selected failure criteria and to rank the selected material IDs, respectively. Finally, by the introduction of different norms to the solution algorithm, the effect of normalization formalism on the material selection using the MADM models is studied. A simple multiaxial strategy is also recommended from which safer engineering decisions may be attained. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The entire pharmaceutical sector is in an urgent need of both innovative technological solutions and fundamental scientific work, enabling the production of highly engineered drug products. Commercial-scale manufacturing of complex drug delivery systems (DDSs) using the existing technologies is challenging. This review covers important elements of manufacturing sciences, beginning with risk management strategies and design of experiments (DoE) techniques. Experimental techniques should, where possible, be supported by computational approaches. With that regard, state-of-art mechanistic process modeling techniques are described in detail. Implementation of materials science tools paves the way to molecular-based processing of future DDSs. A snapshot of some of the existing tools is presented. Additionally, general engineering principles are discussed covering process measurement and process control solutions. Last part of the review addresses future manufacturing solutions, covering continuous processing and, specifically, hot-melt processing and printing-based technologies. Finally, challenges related to implementing these technologies as a part of future health care systems are discussed. © 2015 The Authors.

In this work, we have utilized the theories of decision-making. One of them is the concept of entropy; to evaluate the weight factor for each material property or performance index, and the other is TOPIS; to rank the candidate materials, for which several requirements are considered simultaneously. As an example, the procedure to select the optimal material for a flywheel has been developed. We can grade the candidate materials for given subjective weight. In the cases for which fatigue strength or fracture toughness is weighted, the chosen materials coincide with the ones utilized for a commercial flywheel in support of our approach.},

Although the empirical trial-and-error approach is widely used in coating fabrication, modeling-based methods, such as first-principles calculation, need to be explored and developed. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the design of hard coatings using elastic properties of transition-metal nitrides calculated from first-principles density functional theory. The hardness and ductility trends in these materials are identified using physical and empirical criteria, and validated with experimental observations. Applications of the property trends to materials selection for hard coatings demonstrate that this approach can be used, not only to interpret existing experimental observations, but also to predict new materials with the desired properties for coating design. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.
