abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to review the development of NuvaRing over the past decade to illustrate its use-effectiveness and acceptance as an alternative contraceptive option for women.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The data were extracted from the literature using computerised MEDLINE system. NuvaRing is a new combined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring made of ethylene-vinyl-acetate copolymer, releasing 120 microg etonorgestrel and 15 microg ethinyloestradiol per day. This ring is inserted on any day from day 1 to day 5 of a menstrual cycle for 21 days, thereafter removed for 7 days ring-free period and discarded.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Complete inhibition of ovulation is observed during treatment with this device. Clinical exposure to NuvaRing for 1786 women-years has resulted in 21 pregnancies, giving a Pearl Index of 1.18. Withdrawal bleeding (4.7-5.3 days) is regular (97-99{\%} of cycles) with rare incidence of irregular bleeding (2.6-6.4{\%}). The cycle control is good with the use of this combined contraceptive vaginal ring. NuvaRing is well tolerated and accepted by women as compared to oral pill.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: NuvaRing is an effective vaginal contraceptive option for women. However, further study is needed for monitoring its long-term effectiveness and impact on patient's quality of life since the NuvaRing is marketed in many countries.},

abstract = {Inverse design is a promising approach in the realm of material science for finding structures with desired property. We developed a new package with novel algorithm for inverse design named as IM2ODE (inverse design of Materials by Multi-Objective Differential Evolution). The target properties of concern include the optical and electronic-structure properties of semiconductors, hardness of crystals, etc. IM2ODE can easily predict the atomic configurations with desired properties for three dimensional structure, interface and cluster, even complex defect in solid. Tests have been run on multiple systems and it has been proved that IM2ODE is highly efficient and reliable, which can be applied widely.},

abstract = {The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) is the principal means by which the Executive Branch coordinates science and technology policy across the diverse entities that make up the Federal research and development enterprise. A primary objective of the NSTC is establishing clear national goals for Federal science and technology investments. The NSTC prepares research and development strategies that are coordinated across Federal agencies to form investment packages aimed at accomplishing multiple national goals. The NSTC's work is organized under five committees: (1) Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability; (2) Homeland and National Security; (3) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Education; (4) Science; and (5) Technology. Each of these committees oversees subcommittees and working groups focused on different aspects of science and technology. More information is available at www.WhiteHouse.gov/ostp/nstc. About the Office of Science and Technology Policy The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976. OSTP's responsibilities include advising the President in policy formulation and budget development on questions in which science and technology are important elements; articulating the President's science and technology policy and programs; and fostering strong partnerships among Federal, state, and local governments and the scientific communities in industry and academia. The Director of OSTP also serves as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology and manages the NSTC. More information is available at www.WhiteHouse.gov/ostp.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing is a technology rapidly expanding on a number of industrial sectors. It provides design freedom and environmental/ecological advantages. It transforms essentially design files to fully functional products. However, it is still hampered by low productivity, poor quality and uncertainty of final part mechanical properties. The root cause of undesired effects lies in the control aspects of the process. Optimization is difficult due to limited modelling approaches. Physical phenomena associated with additive manufacturing processes are complex, including melting/solidification and vaporization, heat and mass transfer etc. The goal of the current study is to map available additive manufacturing methods based on their process mechanisms, review modelling approaches based on modelling methods and identify research gaps. Later sections of the study review implications for closed-loop control of the process.},

abstract = {The entire pharmaceutical sector is in an urgent need of both innovative technological solutions and fundamental scientific work, enabling the production of highly engineered drug products. Commercial-scale manufacturing of complex drug delivery systems (DDSs) using the existing technologies is challenging. This review covers important elements of manufacturing sciences, beginning with risk management strategies and design of experiments (DoE) techniques. Experimental techniques should, where possible, be supported by computational approaches. With that regard, state-of-art mechanistic process modeling techniques are described in detail. Implementation of materials science tools paves the way to molecular-based processing of future DDSs. A snapshot of some of the existing tools is presented. Additionally, general engineering principles are discussed covering process measurement and process control solutions. Last part of the review addresses future manufacturing solutions, covering continuous processing and, specifically, hot-melt processing and printing-based technologies. Finally, challenges related to implementing these technologies as a part of future health care systems are discussed. © 2015 The Authors.

In this work, we have utilized the theories of decision-making. One of them is the concept of entropy; to evaluate the weight factor for each material property or performance index, and the other is TOPIS; to rank the candidate materials, for which several requirements are considered simultaneously. As an example, the procedure to select the optimal material for a flywheel has been developed. We can grade the candidate materials for given subjective weight. In the cases for which fatigue strength or fracture toughness is weighted, the chosen materials coincide with the ones utilized for a commercial flywheel in support of our approach.},
