\section{Future Directions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Materials informatics started as simulation, and has been focused on discovery
\item Manufacturing, selection, and optimization present real challenges connecting the research world and the real world
\item There is tremendous opportunity to move the field forward by combining theory, data, and experiment to enable new manufacturing techniques to be implemented faster
\end{itemize}
