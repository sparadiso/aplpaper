Historically, ICME has been focused on these relationships. A challenge remains, though, in the application of ICME-style approaches to materials systems for which deep mechanistic knowledge does not exist. 

Such problems are not limited to the world of structural materials. In the solid state lighting industry, making LED chips that hit very high target performance characteristics is relatively easy, but making a wafer of thousands of those chips remains an unsolved problem. The solid state lighting industry generally solves this by using binning to group similarly performing lamps into buckets, but this creates additional cost and may not be possible in all industries and at all scales. 

\subsection{Current Approaches}
In addition to the use of ICME in alloy development, the pharmaceutical community has made great strides in the connection of discovery, to testing, to manufacturing. There exist a great many simulation techniques model production fluid flows,

Even with a successful history of modeling materials in production, challenges loom on the horizon in parallel with what those of the materials industry: systems are becoming more complex while new, less well understood methods are being called for. This combination only increases the need for analytics systems to be integrated with manufacturing processes.\cite{JPS:JPS24594} Indeed, such issues have been well known in the pharmaceutil

\subsection{Data Infrastructure and Sharing}
While pre-competitive knowledge sharing has been a norm in materials development, infrastructure for the sharing of raw data has only become broadly available over the last decade\cite{CitrineInformatics,MP}. While such resources enable the rapid evaluation of materials at the discovery and selection stages, there has not yet been established a norm of sharing manufacturing process data because data at every stage of the materials development process is often considered trade secret at these companies\cite{TheMinerals2013}. While there is no doubt that there is a move in science broadly to a more open culture around raw data sharing, that culture has not yet led to any widespread data sharing in the manufacturing sector.

There are several government or nonprofit-led efforts to create testbed systems for just such data sharing expressly for the purpose of enabling this sort of sharing. These include ``The Smart Manufacturing Project'' run by the Smart Manufacturing Leadership Coalition and the recent Funding Opportunity Announcement for a Manufacturing Innovation Institute, both funded by the US Department of Energy\cite{SmartManufacturingLeadershipCoalition2013,EERE-MII}. These efforts, while in their early days, seek to create shared infrastructure, testbeds, and systems to motivate organizations of all types (e.g., universities, non-profit research labs, small businesses, and large corporations) to come together for common learning in precompetitive ways. 

One critical step to the implementation of testbeds is the creation of data standards.
